<h1> Deep Neural Networks Practice with TensorFlow</h1>


This project is a hands-on practice focused on experimenting with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using TensorFlow.
It explores various methods, techniques, and different hyperparameter settings to better understand model behavior and performance tuning.

The main goals include:

Building and modifying simple DNN architectures

Trying different activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions

Adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of layers

Observing how small changes impact training dynamics and validation results

Developing intuition for working with deep learning models

This repository is mainly experimental and meant for learning and fun!
